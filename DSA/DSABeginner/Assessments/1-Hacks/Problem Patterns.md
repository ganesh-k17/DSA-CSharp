# Problem Patterns

1) Sliding Window 

* Usage:  This Algorithmic technique is used when we need to handle the input data in a specific window size.
* DS Involved: Array, String, HashTable
* Sample Problems: Longest Substring with 'K' Distinct Characters, Fruits into Baskets.

2) Islands (Matrix Traversal)

* Usage: This patterns describes all the efficient ways of traversing a matrix(or 2D array)
* DS Involved: Matrix, Queue
* Sample Problems: Number of Islands, Flood Fill, Cycle in a matrix

3) Two Pointers

* Usage: This uses two pointers to iterte input data. Generally both pointers move in the opposite direction at a constant interval.
* DS Involved: Array, String, LinkedList
* Problems: Squaring a sorted array, Dutch National Flag Problem, Minimum Window sort

4) Fast & Slow Pointers

* Usage: Also known as hare & Tortoise algorithm, This technique uses two pointers that traverse the input data at different speeds.
* DS Involved: Array, string, LinkedList
* Sample Problems: Middle of the linkedList, Happy Number, Cycle in a circular Array.

5) Merge Intervals

* Usage: This technique is used to deal with overlapping intervals.
* DS Involved: Array, Heap
* Sample Problems: Conflicting Appointments, Minimum Meeting Rooms.

6) Cyclic Sort
7) In-place Reversal of a LinkedList
8) Tree Breadth-First Search
9) Tree Depth First Search
10) Two Heaps
11) Subsets
12) Modified Binary Search
13) Bitwise XOR
14) Top ‘K’ Elements
15) K-way Merge
16) Topological Sort
17) 0/1 Knapsack
18) Fibonacci Numbers
19) Palindromic Subsequence
20) Longest Common Substring
